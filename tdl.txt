- visualcrossing doesn't pull correct time, 
  - need to think of a way to pull current time and change it based on visual crossing's calculated time zone
- need to add error handling (invalid location, couldnt find location, bad server response, couldn't send request, couldn't load, try again, etc)
- add fetching animation
